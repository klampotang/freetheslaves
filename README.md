# FreeTheSlaves

**FreeTheSlaves** was our team's project at Code For Good, Brooklyn. Code For Good is a weekend-long hackathon in which participants partner with a non-profit to help them achieve their goals through technology - such as apps and interfaces. 

We partnered with [Free the Slaves] (http://www.freetheslaves.net/), a non-profit that works to eradicate modern-day slavery around the world. They were looking to move away from their current pencil and paper method of collecting data and surveying to a more high-tech solution that would allow them to translate automatically into different languages and to store their information in a database. We designed and created an iOS app, SMS app, and voice-interactive response system for their purposes. 

## Technology Used

To create our solutions, we used various API and tech including: 
Swift 3 & XCode, PHP, Twilio's API, the Google Translate API

## Awards

Our solutions were chosen as #1 in our category and #1 overall in the hackathon.
